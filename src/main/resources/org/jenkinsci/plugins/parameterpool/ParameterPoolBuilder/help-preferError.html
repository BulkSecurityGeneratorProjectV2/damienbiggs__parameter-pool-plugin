    Check if you want the job to prefer parameter values from failed builds.<br/>
    This can be useful for circumstances where there is a long running build that would refresh an environment.<br/>
    Failed builds are termed any build that was not successful or unstable.<br/>
    This plugin takes the view that unstable builds still were for the most part functional.
