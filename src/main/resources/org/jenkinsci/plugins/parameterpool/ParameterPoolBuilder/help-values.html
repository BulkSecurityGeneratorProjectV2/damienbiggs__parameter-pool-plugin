<div>
    Values for the parameter pool. Separate values by comma.<br/>
    For ranges of values use [start..end]<br/>
    E.g. for say vm1, vm2, vm3, vm4 do vm[1..4]<br/>
    This can be combined with regular parameters.<br/>
    testVm, vm[1..4]<br/>
    will result in a pool of values of testVm, vm1, vm2, vm3, vm4<br/>
    Descending order e.g. vm[4..1] is supported as well.
    The order of the values is also taken into account when selecting from two valid values
</div>
